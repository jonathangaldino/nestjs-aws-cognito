# Node AWS Cognito

Sample app where I add authentication with AWS Cognito to a NestJS app.


## Stack

- Typescript
- NestJS
- [LocalStack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/overview/)
- AWS
- Docker / Compose

The NestJS app runs fully on typescript.
To test my code, to see if it works on AWS, I'm using LocalStack for it.

LocalStack allow us to deploy AWS Services on our marchine, through Docker.
Therefore, I don't need to spend my money starting services on a AWS cloud.
